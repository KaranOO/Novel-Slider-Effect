# Novel-Slider-Effect

## Introduction
The Slider Effect Page project is a visually appealing carousel slider built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases different slides with images, titles, authors, and descriptions, making it ideal for showcasing books, products, or any other items in a stylish and interactive way. _(TBH I loved this animation and enjoying coding such css, so i made this project.)_
